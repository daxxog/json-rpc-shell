json-rpc-shell
==============

`json-rpc-shell' is a trivial shell for running JSON-RPC 2.0 HTTP queries.

This software has been created as a replacement for the following shell, which
is written in Java: http://software.dzhuvinov.com/json-rpc-2.0-shell.html

Fuck Java.  With a sharp, pointy object.  In the ass.  Hard.  json-c as well.

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: CMake, pkg-config, help2man, libev, Jansson, cURL, readline

 $ git clone https://github.com/pjanouch/json-rpc-shell.git
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 $ make

To install the application, you can do either the usual:
 $ make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:
 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i json-rpc-shell-*.deb

Note that for versions of CMake before 2.8.9, you need to prefix cpack with
`fakeroot' or file ownership will end up wrong.

Run the program with `--help' to obtain usage information.
