json-rpc-shell
==============

`json-rpc-shell' is a trivial shell for running JSON-RPC 2.0 HTTP queries.

This software has been created as a replacement for the following shell, which
is written in Java: http://software.dzhuvinov.com/json-rpc-2.0-shell.html

Fuck Java.  With a sharp, pointy object.  In the ass.  Hard.  json-c as well.

Building and Running
--------------------
Build dependencies: clang, pkg-config, GNU make, Jansson, cURL, readline

If you don't have Clang, you can edit the Makefile to use GCC or TCC, they work
just as good.  But there's no CMake support yet, so I force it in the Makefile.

 $ git clone https://github.com/pjanouch/json-rpc-shell.git
 $ make

That is all, no installation is required, or supported for that matter.
